Static Website Generator

Built entirely with HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS.

The goal is to have a simple framework that will output pure HTML at the end.

### Pages:

The core building blocks that define your website's structure.
Each page can contain multiple components and leverage reusable widgets.

### Components:

Represent the logical parts of your app, similar to React components.
Built entirely with HTML, offering full control over the structure.

### Widgets:

Reusable components that encapsulate specific functionalities.
Defined using templates for a consistent look and feel.
Allow passing props (data) to the template for customization.

### Templates:

Act as blueprints for your widgets, defining the overall structure.
Can display and manipulate props passed from the widget for dynamic content. Template can use components and receive props.

---

### In essence:

You build pages by composing components and reusable widgets.
Widgets are defined by templates and customized with props. 

This modular approach promotes clean, maintainable, and scalable static websites.
